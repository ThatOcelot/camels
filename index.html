    <h1>Camels</h1>
		<p>Camels are large even-toed ungulates.</p>
		<p>There are three species of camel; bactrian, dromedary, and wild bactrian.</p>
		<p>Bactrian camels (<i>Camelus bactrianus</i>) are native to the steppes of Central Asia. They have two humps.</p>
		<p>Dromedaries (<i>Camelus dromedarius</i>) are native to the Arabian peninsula and have a single hump.</p>
		<p>Wild bactrian camels (<i>Camelus ferus</i>) are a rare species. There are only about 1400 of them left. Much like domestic bactrians, wild bactrians have two humps. Wild bactrians are the only species to not be domesticated.</p>
